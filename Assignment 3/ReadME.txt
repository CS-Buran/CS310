By far the best algorith for item dispersion was linear probing
Hash Table:  
Keys     Values  
99999 sayan

00001 anotherone

00002 two

00003 three

12345 numbers

23456 hello

00420 fourtwenty

98764 64

09876 random

00504 fiveofour





heeee michael

29872 word

looking at this out put it is obvious that it is rather uniform
with separate chaining however
[]
[]
[]
[Key=99999, Value=sayan]
[]
[]
[]
[]
[]
[Key=00001, Value=one, Key=00001, Value=anotherone]
[Key=00002, Value=two]
[Key=00003, Value=three]
[]
[]
[Key=00420, Value=fourtwenty]
[]
[]
[Key=00504, Value=fiveofour]

we can see that the dispersion is there, however the keys with the same key fall into the same index
